Hi  hello hey
------------
ok.. and no fee for these renewals.. right?
Correct. Just send a copy of the I485 receipt notice to indicate it is pending.
-----------
I asked whether my case has ever been sent to a FO and learnt that the field office was working on the case in May. Then I asked her to check whether my case was sent back to NBC and was it regressed. She was like “is your PD current?” (it raised my hope :-) I said yes, on July 1st! And she confirmed that it was regressed on 5/5 (That’s when my 485J was approved). She said, “I can submit a service request for you, if you like” (I was like “why not?”), and she did! She asked them to review the case and update me with status and estimated time of completion. And asked them to look into the case being marked regressed visa and provide more information regarding that. So that turned the tables… and in less than an hour I got the update “we ordered your new card”!!! Hope this helps a few

Question them, why is USCIS tweeting and calling people to send by fastest courier the RFE responses for medical exams, but on the other hand is sitting on my complete application including medical

Congrats. What did they ask in the interview?

My entire history from the day i entered US to till-date. Questions including my last two clients ( start date, end date, office address) i have worked for and previous employers. Took copies of birth certificates, degree mark sheets, all I797s, all I94s, paystubs, marriage certificate, copies of US port of entry stamps in passports.

=================

We had an interview at Raleigh,NC FO at 10 am. We reached the parking area around 9:30 and checked-in at 9:45. They checked-in via iPad and asked us to sit in Room # 5. Nobody was there in the room except for the iPad and the officer was online. He greeted and first asked us to show the ID proof and also asked us to sign a waiver as our form had been filled by an attorney and we went to the interview without an attorney. And also he asked whether I have medicals to submit.

After that he was looking at the 485 form and started asking all the basic questions like what's your full name, date of birth, when did you last enter the US, have you ever held any other visa, which company are you working for? Are you working with their client, what's the client name, how long have you been working with the client. Have you ever visited your employer? He somehow found that my employer is a small consulting firm so he wanted to check if I ever visited. I replied yes, I visited once or twice. He asked how's the office? I replied it's a small setup office. He asked if anyone else ever filed an immigration petition for you? I replied yes, one of the clients I was working with wanted me to hire so I asked the client to file the petition. So then he asked have you ever stopped working for your employer and I said no. After that he went through all inadmisible questions of i-485 where I replied 'No' except for the citation question where I mentioned that I had a speeding ticket. He concluded his interview with me and started asking the same sort of questions to my wife.

After that he told me that I need you to sign one final form so I am coming to you. He came and got our signatures and told us that I am approving your application and I hope there is nothing in your medicals. I replied no issues in medical. He said you should get your Green Card within 7 to 10 business days. If you are not hearing from us then give us a call after 30 days. 

Overall it took around 20-30 mins. Once we came out and check our status after about 20 mins, our case status was "New Card Is Being Produced"

Greetings. This is Nalla Reddy Jaddu living in San Ramon,CA since 2005. 

I came to US in Sep 2005 and I have applied for the permanent residency in Feb 2011.  My I-485 application received date is Oct 19th 2020. My application priority dates got current and but don't see any updates online.. when I check with USCIS agents (thru chat & call) , I'm getting different responses like one time they say my application it is at Sacramento Field Office, another time its is with SFO Field office, and then Santa Ana office. and later with NBC. There is a lot of conflict in the information. My case doesn't have any pending documents. I have submitted my medicals as well. 

 USCIS is tweeting and calling people to send by fastest courier the RFE responses for medical exams, but on the other hand there is no progress on my completed application.

I see many applications which are later than my priority date and received date are getting the updates. But I dont see any updates online and getting conflict responses from USCIS agents.

I have US born kid and he is in 8th grade now. It will be difficult for him if we move anywhere else due to this uncertainty in my application processing.

It would be grateful if we know the status of my application and process it in the timely manner
